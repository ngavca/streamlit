Description:
This program analyzes the skyscrapers dataset by creating two different charts: scatter plot and barchart.
The scatter plot measures the relationship between the year the skyscraper was built and it's height. In addition,
user may choose what he/she desires to display on the page by checking the according radio button on the sidebar(r-value,
min,max,mean, standard deviation). The bar chart allows the user to choose the specific countries and its skyscrapers
to display as well as set the height limit for the skyscrapers using the slider.
