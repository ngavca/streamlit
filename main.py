Data Set: Skyscrapers around the World

Description:
This project analyzes the skyscrapers dataset taken from kaggle database by creating a dataframe with two different charts: scatter plot and barchart.
The scatter plot measures the relationship between the year the skyscraper was built and it's height. In addition,
user may choose what he/she desires to display on the page by checking the according radio button on the sidebar(r-value,
min,max,mean, standard deviation). The bar chart allows the user to choose the specific countries and its skyscrapers
to display as well as set the height limit for the skyscrapers using the slider"

# First we need to import the necessary modules for this project
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# The modules have now been imported and we can start creating the functions that we would need for our analysis.

# Before we start building graphs,we first need to create a function that would read in the data when we compile our main function
# as well as clean the data a bit by choosing which columns we want to use in our analysis

# We have successfully create the read_data function which reads the csv file data and did some cleaning by choosing
# only the columns that we need in our data such as the "Name", "Country", "Metres", "City", "Lat", "Lon" columns

# Next we need to create a function that would read in the all the skyscrapers and create a list that we can use
# for our sidebar.multiselect feature that we will use later in our main function. This will enable the user to choose
# which countries he/she wants to be displayed in the bargraph in order to compare the amount of skyscrapers each country has.
